**Nanofetch** is a **lightweight, fast, and customizable** command-line tool for displaying system information in a visually clean way ‚Äî inspired by [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) and [Fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch).

Written in **C++**, focused on **speed**, **simplicity**, and **clarity**.  
Its goal is to be a minimal yet flexible alternative to Fastfetch for users who prefer simplicity or smaller systems.

> ‚ö° Currently supports only **Arch-based distributions** that use `makepkg`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Simply download the appropriate file in the `nanofetch` folder and install it according to your distribution.  
For example, on Arch-based systems:

```bash
makepkg -si

After installation via makepkg -si, the files will be located as follows:
System files (installed by the package)

/usr/bin/nanofetch                    # Executable file
/usr/share/nanofetch/logo.txt         # Default system logo
/usr/share/nanofetch/config.txt       # System gradient configuration
/usr/share/nanofetch/options.txt      # System options
/usr/share/nanofetch/settings.txt     # System settings

User configuration (created on first launch)

~/.config/nanofetch/logo.txt          # Your personal logo
~/.config/nanofetch/config.txt        # Your gradients
~/.config/nanofetch/options.txt       # Your options
~/.config/nanofetch/settings.txt      # Your settings

üß† How It Works

    During installation:
    Files are copied to /usr/share/nanofetch/.

    On first launch:
    nanofetch automatically creates ~/.config/nanofetch/ and copies files from /usr/share/nanofetch/ into it.

    On subsequent launches:
    The program reads configurations from ~/.config/nanofetch/.

üìÇ File Management
Check file locations

# System files
ls -la /usr/share/nanofetch/

# User files (after first launch)
ls -la ~/.config/nanofetch/

# Check which files were installed by the package
pacman -Ql nanofetch

Edit configuration

# Edit your personal settings
nano ~/.config/nanofetch/settings.txt

# Change gradients
nano ~/.config/nanofetch/config.txt

# Change logo
nano ~/.config/nanofetch/logo.txt

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
    Always edit the files in ~/.config/nanofetch/, not in /usr/share/nanofetch/, because system files are overwritten on updates.
