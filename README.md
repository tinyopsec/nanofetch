Nanofetch is a **lightweight, fast, and customizable** command-line tool for displaying system information in a visually clean way — inspired by [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) and [Fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch).

Written in **C**, focused on **speed**, **simplicity**, and **clarity**.  
Its goal is to be a minimal yet flexible alternative to Fastfetch for users who prefer simplicity or smaller systems.

> ⚡ Nanofetch currently supports only **Arch-based distributions** that use `makepkg`.
